## üéØ System Overview

The Legal QA System is an AI-powered platform designed to answer legal questions using a hybrid approach that combines traditional information retrieval with modern generative AI. The system processes questions about Indian law across three major domains: Constitution, Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), and Indian Penal Code (IPC).

- **CrPC Dataset**: 1,010 Q&A pairs covering criminal procedure code
- **IPC Dataset**: 1,010 Q&A pairs covering Indian penal code
- **Total**: 3,042 Q&A pairs across 3 legal domains
- **Format**: JSON with structured fields (question, answer, category, metadata)

#### 1.2 Data Preprocessing
- **Text Normalization**: Case normalization, punctuation standardization
- **Tokenization**: spaCy-based tokenization for consistent processing
