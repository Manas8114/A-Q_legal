# Logger Fix Summary

## Issue
The `aqlegal_enhanced_app.py` file was using `logger` without properly importing it, causing the error:
```
Failed to load models: name 'logger' is not defined
```

## Fix Applied
Added proper logger import to `aqlegal_enhanced_app.py`:

```python
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

## Verification
âœ… The app now loads successfully without errors
âœ… All logger statements in the file now work properly
âœ… The system is ready to run

## Files Checked
All files in the project that use `logger` have been verified to have proper imports:
- âœ… `aqlegal_enhanced_app.py` - **FIXED**
- âœ… All files in `src/` directory - Already have proper imports
- âœ… All setup and training scripts - Already have proper imports

## Next Steps
You can now run the enhanced app with:
```bash
streamlit run aqlegal_enhanced_app.py
```

## Status
ðŸŸ¢ **All logger-related issues resolved**
